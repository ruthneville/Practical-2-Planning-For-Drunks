# Practical 2 Planning For Drunks

<h1> ReadME </h1>

<h2> Introduction </hr><br>
A repository of code related to Practical 2 for the module GEOG5995M. The code is written using Python 3 in the IDE Spyder. 
 
<h2> Contents </h2>

<p> This project contains a model, an associated drunk framework and a file to run the environment. The model is successful in that it is able to programme 25 drunks to make their way home from the pub using a random walk within a town environment. This zip file also includes a supporting document which outlines the intention of the software, the issues that came up during the development, the sources used, and the overall development process and testing and a license file </p>.

<h2> How to run and what to expect </h2>
<li> Copy the Drunk Model code into one workbook in Spyder and the drunk framework code into another, make sure that these are both saved in the same deictory. </li>
<li> Save the 'drunkplan.txt' (environment) file to the same area. </li>
<li> At present the model is set up to have 25 drunks which move randomly within the environment (town) until they reach their allocated home, with their steps being traced and mapped as they go. The model is set to iterate 100,000 times. </li>
<li> Run the model, the plot will be produced and it is expected that information will appear in the console as each drunk reaches their home, and that the drunks will be plotted at their homes. A timer will also run to check how long it takes them to get home. Drunks are marked by small red triangles. </li>
